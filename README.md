## Defining goals and objectives

The goal of this working group is to collect and classify correspondence tables between existing classifications, distinguishing between products, activities and elementary flows (all correpsondence tables shall be in machine-readable format) and to convert the correspondence tables in RDF format for entry into the database. 

All updates on the correspondence table shall be reported in the overview file above named '_Overview_of_available_correspondence_files'
(e.g. add new table, change status of existing file etc)

## Hackathon Deliverables

These can be grouped into "before", "during", and "stretch" goals.

### Before the hackathon

* Collect and classify in this directory existing correspondence tables, distinguishing between activities, products and elementary flows tables (converted in csv) previously on the BONSAI goolge drive. (DONE) 
* Upload the converted tables in this directory and delete them from the goolge drive (after a month). (DONE)
* Add missing classification, if any.
* Discuss and provide recommendations on dealing with 1-N, N-1, M-N situations

### During the hackathon

Convert the correspondence tables in RDF format for entry into the database.

### Stretch goals

 Expand the correspondence tables converted in RDF format to allow traversing as many classifications as possible.
